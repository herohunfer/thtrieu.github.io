### Monologue

I'm an engineer from heart, which means I solve maths, read physics and do computer stuff. Fortunately, my outdoor activities is not that dull. I traveled as far as the Scandinavies and Southeast Asia for leadership conferences (side note, my social awkwardness is still incurable).

Did a couple of AI-related internships in different labs as far apart as Eastern Canada and Western Japan. Still counting. Projects are as diverse as _Data mining_, _Natural Language Processing_, and _Computer Vision_. _Deep Learning_ is the tool of use (still improving on it though).

Never mind the buzzwords - my interest is as innocent as the next guy: _what is intelligence?_ Can we build such a thing? How? What does it mean if human are indeed capable of creating one? These actually belong to a much broader theme _How come universe?_ that I'd love to know an answer to,  besides \\( 42 \\).

So yes, this universe thing fascinates me. I mean, curved space-time and undetermined past? Com'on! I am more than open to learn from anyone who has anything to share, be it philosophy, alchemy, unicorn rainbow magic, or how stupid I am. Yes seriously, do tell me about it.
