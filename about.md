### Short intro

Junior undergrad, engineer from heart. Which means I solve maths, read physics and do computer stuff. Did a couple of AI-related internships in labs as far apart as crossing the Pacific Ocean. Three and still counting. Projects are as diverse as _Data Mining_, _Natural Language Processing_, and _Computer Vision_. The recently-fashionable _Deep Learning_ is my main tool.

_Bottom line: All that and I'm still figuring how to be somewhat worthy to this world._
