### Monolouge

I am a junior undergrad. The world fascinates me! I seek answer for many questions

- How far have we go explaining the physical world? What are the lessons?
- What is reality? Is the world we're living in simulated?
- How does the brain work? Is there free will? 
- How to define intelligence? Can we create one? How?
- Are we intelligent as oppose to the unintelligents, or we are simply a point in a much wider spectrum? 
- Are we alone? Will we ever be able to reach interstellar technologies? 
- What will _'A brief history of time 2.0'_ published in 3095 talk about?
- Will mathematics and physics ever be obsolete tools? 
- Are human destined to become scientific or are we simply on a journey of becoming a religious species?
