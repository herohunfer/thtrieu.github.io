No, my social life is actually quite awesome...

I traveled to Norway, seriously discussed art and corruption in a suit before wildly making love to a wooden table in front of two lady strangers. Proudly destroyed three portions of smoked meat in one sitting at a famous restaurant to be branded as manliest diner by the staff. Learn Chinese swearing (out loud) while taking a bus full of French-speaking Canadians. Interned at an international fashion company, wear colorful kid's socks, slept through an entire meeting and had a delicious lunch with the beautiful CEO. And oh that time though, selfied while Dalai Lama (with his holiness of course) sneezing in the background...

Nevermind.

But why AI? My intellectual interest is in fact as innocent as the next guy: _what is intelligence?_ Can we build such a thing? How? What does it mean if human are indeed capable of creating one? These actually belong to a much broader theme _How come universe?_ - whose answer I'd love to catch a glimpse of, rooting for something other than \\( 42 \\). So yes, this universe thing fascinates me. I mean, curved _Spacetime_, _undetermined Past_, and _11-dimensional multiverse_? Com'on, whoever this guy that invented the world, deserves my resounding pat on the shoulder! I am more than open to learn from anyone who has anything to share, be it philosophy, alchemy, unicorn rainbow magic, or how stupid I am. Yes seriously, do tell me about it :)
