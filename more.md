I traveled as far as the Scandinavies from Southeast Asia - just to leave right before Northen Lights happens. There I discussed art and corruption before passionately making love to a wooden table, where two young ladies had to stop drinking because of the situation's gruesomeness. Still not sure they are grossed out because of the interspecies intercourse or the fact that it lasted for only about one minute. That asides, I did proudly and singlehandedly destroy a three-man portion of smoked meat in front of the staff at Montreal's famous _Schwartz Deli_, for absolutely no standing ovation at all. I also dressed pink underwear and colorful kid's socks going to work at an international techni fashion company - had a delicious lunch with the beautiful CEO by the way. And oh that time, selfied while Dalai Lama (with his holiness of course) sneezing in the background getting too concerned about civil education at college level.

Nevermind.

Wait but Why AI though? My intellectual interest is in fact as innocent as the next guy: _what is intelligence?_ Can we build such a thing? How? What does it mean if human are indeed capable of creating one? These actually belong to a much broader theme _How come universe?_ - whose answer I'd love to sneak a peek, rooting for something other than \\( 42 \\).

So yes, this universe thing fascinates me. I mean, curved Spacetime and undetermined Past? Com'on, whoever this guy that created the world, deserves a resounding pat on the shoulder! I am more than open to learn from anyone who has anything to share, be it philosophy, alchemy, unicorn rainbow magic, or how stupid I am. Yes seriously, do enlighten me about it.
