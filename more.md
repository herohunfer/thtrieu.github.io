As a geek, my social life is kinda awesome ...

I traveled to Northern Europe, seriously discussed art and corruption in a suit before wildly making love to a wooden table. Two lady drinkers grossed out, not sure because of the intercourse or the fact that it lasted for only one minute. That asides, I proudly destroyed three portions of smoked meat in one sitting at Montreal's famous _Schwartz Deli_, get branded as the manliest diner of the night by its staff. I also wear colorful kid's socks to an international techni fashion company - slept through an entire meeting and still had a delicious lunch with the beautiful CEO. And oh that time though, selfied while Dalai Lama (with his holiness of course) sneezing in the background getting too concern about college student's civil education...

Nevermind.

But why AI? My intellectual interest is in fact as innocent as the next guy: _what is intelligence?_ Can we build such a thing? How? What does it mean if human are indeed capable of creating one? These actually belong to a much broader theme _How come universe?_ - whose answer I'd love to catch a glimpse of, rooting for something other than \\( 42 \\). So yes, this universe thing fascinates me. I mean, curved _Spacetime_, _undetermined Past_, and _11-dimensional multiverse_? Com'on, whoever this guy that invented the world, deserves my resounding pat on the shoulder! I am more than open to learn from anyone who has anything to share, be it philosophy, alchemy, unicorn rainbow magic, or how stupid I am. Yes seriously, do tell me about it :)
