In restropect, my social life is kinda strange...

I traveled as far as the Scandivanies from Southeast Asia, seriously discussed art and corruption in a suit before wildly making love to a wooden table in front of two lady strangers. Learn Chinese swearing (out loud) while taking a bus full of French-speaking Canadians. Interned at a techni-fashion startup wearing colorful kid's socks, accidently slept through an entire meeting, still had a delicious lunch with the CEO. And oh that time though, selfied while Dalai Lama (with his holiness of course) sneezing in the background...

Nevermind.

But why AI? My intellectual interest is in fact as innocent as the next guy: _what is intelligence?_ Can we build such a thing? How? What does it mean if human are indeed capable of creating one? These actually belong to a much broader theme _How come universe?_ - whose answer I'd love to catch a glimpse of, rooting for something other than \\( 42 \\). So yes, this universe thing fascinates me. I mean, curved _Spacetime_, _undetermined Past_, and _11-dimensional multiverse_? Com'on, whoever this guy that invented the world, deserves my resounding pat on the shoulder! I am more than open to learn from anyone who has anything to share, be it philosophy, alchemy, unicorn rainbow magic, or how stupid I am. Yes seriously, do tell me about it :)
